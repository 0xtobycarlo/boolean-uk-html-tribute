        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>
                'Satoshi Nakamoto' is the pseudonym used by the creator of the Bitcoin protocol. Nakamoto conceptualised and authored the Bitcoin white-paper (released October 31st 2008), amidst a global financial crisis. 
                The white-paper was published onto a cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com, describing a digital cryptocurrency, titled <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/annual-national-training-seminar/2018/Emerging_Tech_Bitcoin_Crypto.pdf" target="_blank" >"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".</a>
                As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database - sparking an entire industry to be formed utilising blockchain technology and harnessing it for its potential benefits in healthcare, voting etc.
                Nakamoto has stated that his work on developing Bitcoin began in 2007, and on the 18th of August 2008, the domain <a href="https://www.bitcoin.org" target="_blank" >bitcoin.org</a> was registered.
                On 9th January 2009, version 0.1 of the Bitcoin software was released by Nakamoto onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge" target="_blank" >SourceForge</a>, and launched the network by defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Blockchain" target="_blank" >genesis block of Bitcoin</a> (block number 0), which had a reward of 50BTC.
                Nakamoto is believed to own between 750,000 and 1,100,000 BTC - as of the current all-time high (1 BTC = £50,000) - Nakamoto would possess a wealth of approximately £45,000,000,000,000. Some theorists have suggested that Nakamoto's BTC holdings are a puzzle meant to be solved by computational power.

        <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>
                In short, Bitcoin is a system for electronic transactions that does not rely on a central intermediary (VISA, banks, etc) to trust. The coins are made using digital signatures, which provides a strong control of ownership, but it is incomplete in a way to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending" target="_blank" >double-spending</a>. 
                To solve the issue of double-spending, Satoshi proposed a 'peer-to-peer network' using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work" target="_blank" >'proof-of-work'</a>, to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.
                Nodes work will little coordination, and they do not need to be identified. To transact on the Bitcoin network, all you need is a Bitcoin address, a BTC balance, and an internet connection - no KYC is required - all users remain pseudonymous.

        <h2>What did Satoshi Solve?</h2>
        <ol>
            <p>
                The problem with attempts at digital currencies in the past, such as <a href="http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt" target="_blank" >'b-money'</a>, proposed by Wei Dai in 1998, and <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf" target="_blank" >'Hashcash</a>, proposed by Adam Back in 2002, is that they all ended up relying on a central intermediary to validate transactions on the network.
                Nakamoto, with his peer-to-peer network, and the conceptualisation of a blockchain, managed to solve this issue and create the first digital currency that did not require a third party for validation and trust. All transactions are recorded onto a distributed public ledger - maintained by the network nodes - the inputs are immutable, meaning that the data on the blockchain cannot be changed.
                This feature highlights the potential of using blockchain technology to cast political votes in the future as to deterr any election manipulation as we have seen in the past.
